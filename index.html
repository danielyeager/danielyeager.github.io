            <p> 
              Cameron McKay more comonly known on the internet as Fitz, is a very humorous person and improv comedian and his style is really full of humor and that inspires me. I also like watching his videos and listening to his podcast because they make me laugh and help brightn my day. He is also the host of a podcast and has good time managment and leadership skills. This is why i am paying my tribute to Fitz.
